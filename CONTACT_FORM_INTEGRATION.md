# Contact Form Integration with Resend

## Overview
The contact page has been successfully integrated with Resend to send emails to hello@isthestockmarketopen.io.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Server Action (`app/actions/send-email.ts`)
- **Email validation**: Uses Zod schema to validate form inputs
- **Resend integration**: Sends emails via Resend API
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling for validation and API failures
- **Security**: Server-side validation and processing

### 2. Contact Form Updates (`app/contact/page.tsx`)
- **Server Actions**: Uses `useFormState` and `useFormStatus` for form handling
- **Real-time feedback**: Shows success/error messages after submission
- **Form reset**: Automatically clears form after successful submission
- **Loading states**: Proper loading indicators during submission

### 3. Email Configuration
- **From address**: `Contact Form <noreply@isthestockmarketopen.io>`
- **To address**: `hello@isthestockmarketopen.io`
- **Reply-to**: Set to the sender's email address for easy responses
- **HTML formatting**: Professional email template with contact details

## Environment Variables Required
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Features
✅ **Form validation** - Client and server-side validation  
✅ **Email sending** - Real emails sent via Resend  
✅ **Error handling** - User-friendly error messages  
✅ **Success feedback** - Confirmation messages  
✅ **Form reset** - Automatic form clearing after success  
✅ **Loading states** - Visual feedback during submission  
✅ **Security** - Server-side processing only  

## Testing
The integration has been tested and verified to work correctly. Test emails are successfully delivered to hello@isthestockmarketopen.io.

## Security Considerations
- Form data is validated server-side using Zod
- No sensitive data is exposed to the client
- Uses environment variables for API keys
- Server actions prevent direct API access

## Performance
- Uses React Server Components where possible
- Minimal client-side JavaScript
- Efficient form handling with useFormState
- No unnecessary re-renders

## Future Enhancements
- Rate limiting for form submissions
- Spam protection (reCAPTCHA)
- Email templates customization
- Contact form analytics
